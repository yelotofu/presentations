== New and Noteworthy ==

== 1.0.1 ==

* Added remoteAttr, toggleClass, emtpy and remove to the list of registered core DOM manipulation methods
* Removed setInterval in favor of on-demand setTimeout
* Calling livequery with the same arguments (function references), restarts the existing Live Query instead of creating a new one
